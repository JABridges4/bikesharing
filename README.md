# Bikesharing

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to look at CitiBike data for the month of August in order to detect trends in terms of who is using bikes, at what times, and locations. We then display the data using Tableau in order to convince investors that a similar business is possible in Des Moines.

## Results
Throughout all of the visualizations there are four main conclusions:
.The vast majority of CitiBike users are males who are also subscribers
. The trip times are generally very short
. Weekdays are more popular than weekends
. The most common hours are 8-9am and 5-6pm, likely meaning that people are taking bikes short distances to and from work instead of walking or taking public transport

## Summary
I believe that a business similar to CitiBike may have a difficult time in Des Moines. From the analysis, it seems most users are taking bikes short distances to get to and from work. I doubt that there is such a struggle in Des Moines in order to create enough demand for a business to be successful. There are a couple more graphs I would like to create from the data. One is to look at the age distribution amongst CitiBike users. Another would be to look at the top destinations in order to see if there is any trends that would could use to predict popular locations for the future.
